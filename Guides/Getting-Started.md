# Welcome to the server!
## This guide is meant to get you up and running in the now very hostile and difficult world of Minecraft.

There are a few things which you want to start off with when just joining the world. I've listed them down here:
1. Open your inventory and go to quests (left upper corner). In the Gettin' Started group there is a checkmark right next to the wood types named "Welcome!". Click this, check the checkmark and accept the items, as this gives you full leather armor, a wooden sword and a wooden axe.
2. Start constructing your own little shelter and keep using the Gettin' Started quests to progress just a little faster.
3. Gather some iron. Once you have 2 iron ingots, get yourself 4 planks and create a smithing table.
---!      The smithing table is very useful, even early game! Apotheosis adds gems which can be socketed into tools, weapons and armor. Having a socketed stone sword is already better than a vanilla stone sword!      !---

4. Craft additional armor (accessories) and normal armor.
- Basic Belt: 4 leather (top, right, down, left). Adds 1 armor toughness.
- Iron/Gold Ring: 4 iron or gold (top, right, down, left). Adds no stats on its own, does have socketed stat. If they don't have socketed stat: Apotheosis grading is needed and making this armor now has no use.
- Iron/Gold Pendant: 5 string, 1 iron or gold. Adds no stats on its own, does has socketed stat.
- Leather/Iron/Gold Gloves: 2 leather/iron/gold. Place them in middle left and middle right crafting slots. Adds some attack damage depending on material.


Add the following later to Nether path:
- Craft Aether Iron/Gold/Zanite ring, turn it into Ice Ring. Makes 3x3 blocks of water or lava turn into ice or obsidian respectively.
- Iron Ring has no added stats on its own.
- Gold Ring has no added stats on its own.
- Zanite Ring uses durability to increase mining speed.

- Craft Aether Iron/Gold/Zanite Pendant and turn it into Ice Pendant. Makes 3x3 blocks of water or lava turn into ice or obsidian respectively.
- Iron Pendant has no added stats on its own.
- Gold Pendant has no added stats on its own.
- Zanite Pendant uses durability to increase mining speed.
